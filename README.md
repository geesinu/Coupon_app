# Coupon App

## Overview
Coupon App is a dynamic web application designed to streamline the distribution of unique, non-repeating coupons via QR code scans. This system is particularly useful in promotional or event scenarios where fair and controlled distribution of coupons is necessary.

## Key Features
 - **QR Code Scanning**: Users can scan a QR code that directs them to retrieve their unique digital coupon, enhancing the user experience and accessibility.
 - **Non-Repeating Coupons**: Ensures that each coupon is unique and can only be used once, preventing reuse and ensuring fair distribution.
 - **Advanced Technologies**: Built with Django, the app leverages robust frameworks and databases such as SQLite in development and PostgreSQL in production environments.
 - **Security Measures**: Implements IP fingerprinting to prevent users from claiming multiple coupons, thereby maintaining the integrity of the coupon distribution process.
 - **Deployment**: Deployed on Heroku for easy access and scalability, ensuring that the application can handle high user traffic and data loads efficiently.

## Development and Deployment
The application utilizes Django as its core framework, supporting both SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production. It is designed to be scalable and secure, with deployment facilitated through Heroku, which simplifies application management and scaling.
